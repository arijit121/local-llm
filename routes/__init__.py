routes/__init__.py — Routes Package Initializer
===========================================================================

PURPOSE:
    This file makes the "routes" folder a Python PACKAGE.

WHAT IS A PYTHON PACKAGE?
    A Python package is just a folder that contains an __init__.py file.
    This lets you import modules from the folder like:
        from routes.api_routes import router

    Without __init__.py, Python wouldn't recognize "routes" as a package.

NOTE:
    This file can be empty! Just its existence is enough to make
    the folder a package. But we add this comment to explain why it's here.
